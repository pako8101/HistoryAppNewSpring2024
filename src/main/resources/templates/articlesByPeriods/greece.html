    <h2 style="color: #117a8b;" class="title period">Ancient Greece</h2>
    <div class="subhead">Ancient Greek civilization, the period following Mycenaean
        civilization, which ended about 1200 BCE, to the death of Alexander the Great,
        in 323 BCE. It was a period of political, philosophical, artistic,
        and scientific achievements that formed a legacy with unparalleled influence.
        The larger historical period spanning from the output of ancient Greek author
        Homer in the 8th century BCE to the decline of the Roman Empire
        in the 5th century CE is known as "Classical antiquity,"
        encompassing Greco-Roman culture, playing a major role in
        the Mediterranean sphere of influence and in the creation of Western civilization,
        and shaping areas as diverse as law, architecture,
        art, language, poetry, rhetoric, politics, and philosophy.</div>

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
                and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
                foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
                noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks,
                and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects

                and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty!</p></div>
