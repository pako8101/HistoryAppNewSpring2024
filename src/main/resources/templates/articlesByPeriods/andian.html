    <div class="subhead">The customs and social systems of South American peoples are closely and naturally related to the environments in which they live. These environmental relationships are mediated by the systems of technology that the people use to exploit their resources.

        Four basic types of social and cultural organization of South American peoples
        emerge from the archaeological and historical records:
        central Andean irrigation civilizations,
        chiefdoms of the northern Andes and the circum-Caribbean,
        tropical-forest farming villages, and  nomadic hunters and gatherers.
        Each type developed in its own fashion during thousands of years,
        and since the 16th century
        each has made a distinctive adjustment to the impact of European civilization.</div>

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
                and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
                foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
                noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks,
                and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects

                and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty!</p></div>
