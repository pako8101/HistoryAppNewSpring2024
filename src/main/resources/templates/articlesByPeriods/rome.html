    <div class="subhead">Roman Empire, the ancient empire,
        centred on the city of Rome, that was established in 27 BCE following
        the demise of the Roman Republic and continuing to the final eclipse of the
        empire of the West in the 5th century CE. A brief treatment of
        the Roman Empire follows.

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
                and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
                foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
                noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks,
                and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects

                and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty!</p></div>
