    <h2 style="color: #117a8b;" class="title period">Central North America</h2>

    <div class="subhead">The ancestors of contemporary American Indians were members
        of nomadic hunting and gathering cultures.
        These peoples traveled in small family-based bands that moved from Asia to
        North America during the last ice age; from approximately 30,000–12,000 years ago,
        sea levels were so low that a “land bridge” connecting the two continents was
        exposed. Some bands followed the Pacific coast southward,
        and others followed a glacier-free corridor through the centre of what is now Canada.
        Although it is clear that both avenues were used,
        it is not certain which was more important in the peopling of the Americas.
        Most traces of this episode in human prehistory have been erased by millennia of geological processes:
        the Pacific has inundated or washed away most of the coastal migration route,
        and glacial meltwash has destroyed or deeply buried traces of the inland journey.

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
                and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
                foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
                noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks,
                and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects

                and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty!</p></div>
