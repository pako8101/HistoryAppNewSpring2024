<div class="subhead">Stone Age, prehistoric cultural stage,
    or level of human development, characterized by the creation and use of stone tools.
    The Stone Age, whose origin coincides with the discovery of the oldest known
    stone tools, which have been dated to some 3.3 million years ago, is usually
    divided into three separate periods—Paleolithic Period, Mesolithic Period, and Neolithic
    Period—based on the degree of sophistication in the fashioning and use of tools.</div>

            When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
            and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
            foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
            stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
            noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks,
            and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects

            and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty!</p></div>
