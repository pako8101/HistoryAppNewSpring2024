    <div class="subhead">History of Mesopotamia, history of the region in
        southwestern Asia where the world’s earliest civilization developed.
        The name comes from a Greek word meaning “between rivers,”
        referring to the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,
        but the region can be broadly defined to include the area that is
        now eastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and most of Iraq.
        The region was the centre of a culture whose influence extended throughout
        the Middle East and as far as the Indus valley, Egypt, and the Mediterranean.</div>

                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
                and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
                foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                stream;<p>and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
                noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks,
                and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects

                and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty!</p></div>
