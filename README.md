Mapping
ModelMaper - In this project, I employ ModelMaper to simplify the mapping between different types of objects, particularly between entity models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). MapStruct is a convenient and efficient code generation library that automates the process of mapping by generating mapping code during the compilation phase.

JWT Authentication
Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated and stored as an HTTP-only secure cookie in the browser.

 Expiration: The token expires after 24 hours.

Custom Exceptions
Custom exceptions are used to handle specific errors or exceptional cases in the application, improving error handling and providing meaningful feedback to users or clients.

Interceptor for Banned Users
An interceptor is implemented to handle access control for banned users within the application. When a registerDTO attempts to access restricted resources or endpoints, this interceptor checks whether the registerDTO has been banned. If the registerDTO is identified as banned, access to the requested resource is denied.

Exception Handling
Custom exception handling is implemented within the application to manage and respond to exceptional situations or errors that occur during the runtime of the system. These exceptions are designed to capture specific scenarios and provide appropriate responses to users or client applications.

Testing
 Junit
 Mockito
 
 Integration tests
The project includes JUnit and Mockito for unit testing and integration tests with inmemory database, ensuring the reliability and correctness of various components within the application. This structure provides a clear and organized overview of both the frontend and backend aspects of the project, detailing the technologies, functionalities, and methodologies utilized.
